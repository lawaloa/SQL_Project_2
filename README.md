## 📘 Introduction – Setting the stage for our data exploration journey
This project seeks to confront the pressing **Maji Ndogo water crisis** through the lens of **SQL analysis**.  
Rather than treating our dataset as disconnected numbers, we view it as a living story — each row and column carrying the experiences of citizens, workers, and communities.  

Our mission is to:  
- Step back from isolated data points to discover patterns and hidden correlations.  
- Use clustering and aggregation to reveal systemic narratives.  
- Treat data with integrity by validating, auditing, and ensuring trustworthiness.  
- Provide both granular insights (individual sources, employees, queues) and a panoramic overview (locations, quality, availability).  

By weaving together details and broad patterns, this project aims not only to **understand the scope of the problem** but also to **inspire actionable solutions**.

## 🗂️ Cleaning Our Data – Updating employee data
SQL queries are used to validate, normalize, and update employee information.  
This ensures that operational records are trustworthy before deeper analysis.  

---

## 🙌 Honouring the Workers – Finding our best
Acknowledging the contributions of frontline workers while using SQL to identify top performers and practices that can be scaled across the system.  

---

## 🌍 Analysing Locations – Understanding where the water sources are
Mapping the distribution of water sources, identifying underserved areas, and highlighting clusters that demand urgent attention.  

---

## 💦 Diving into the Sources – Seeing the scope of the problem
Analyzing the quality, reliability, and accessibility of each water source, while quantifying the true extent of the crisis.  

---

## 🛠️ Start of a Solution – Thinking about how we can repair
Exploring interventions such as infrastructure repairs, improved allocation, or resource optimization — modeled through SQL insights.  

---

## 📊 Analysing Queues – Uncovering when citizens collect water
Investigating collection patterns, peak demand times, and the stress they place on both citizens and infrastructure.  

---

## 📝 Reporting Insights – Assembling our insights into a story
Transforming raw queries into meaningful narratives that stakeholders can understand.  
Our final deliverable is not just a dataset, but a **story of resilience, challenge, and possibility**.
