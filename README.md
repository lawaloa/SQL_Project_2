## 📘 Project Overview  – Setting the stage for our data exploration journey
--- 

This project is personal to me because it goes beyond running SQL queries — it’s about telling the story of the **Maji Ndogo water crisis** through data.  

When I first explored the dataset, I didn’t just see rows and columns. I saw communities waiting in long queues, families depending on unsafe water, and field workers trying their best to bridge a massive gap.  

Here’s how I approached it:  
- I started by **cleaning and validating the data** to make sure the foundation was trustworthy.  
- Then, I used **clustering and aggregation** to uncover the bigger narratives hidden beneath isolated records.  
- I treated each data point as someone’s lived experience — not just a number — which made **integrity checks and auditing** essential.  
- Finally, I zoomed in on both **granular details** (individual sources, employees, queues) and the **big picture** (provincial coverage, quality, and availability).  

For me, this project isn’t just about technical SQL skills. It’s about showing how **data can become a voice** — turning hidden patterns into insights that can guide real-world solutions for the communities who need them most.  

✅ **Skills Applied:** SQL · Data Aggregation · Counting · Grouping · Filtering · Data Validation · Data Exploration · Queue Analysis · Window Functions · Ranking Queries · Analytical Thinking · Data Storytelling

## 🗂️ Cleaning Our Data – Updating employee data
---

This was one of my favorite parts of the project because it reminded me that **data tells stories only when it’s clean and reliable**. In this section, I focused on improving the integrity of the **employee table** in our database.  

When I first pulled it up, I noticed something was missing: **email addresses**. Since we’ll need to send workers reports and figures, I had to generate the emails in a consistent format. Luckily, the convention for our department is straightforward: `first_name.last_name@ndogowater.gov`


### 🔧 My Approach  

To build these emails, I:  
- Selected the `employee_name` column.  
- Replaced the space in names with a full stop (`.`).  
- Converted everything to lowercase.  
- Concatenated it with `@ndogowater.gov`.  

Before updating the database permanently, I first tested the format with a `SELECT` query.  

```sql
-- Preview email format before updating
SELECT
    CONCAT(
        LOWER(REPLACE(employee_name, ' ', '.')),
        '@ndogowater.gov'
    ) AS new_email
FROM md_water_services.employee;
```

Once I confirmed the format, I updated the table:

```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

UPDATE md_water_services.employee
SET email = CONCAT(
    LOWER(REPLACE(employee_name, ' ', '.')),
    '@ndogowater.gov'
);
```

### 📱 Cleaning Phone Numbers

While reviewing the table, I also found another issue: **phone numbers**.
They should have been stored as 12 characters (`+99` + 9 digits), but when I checked with `LENGTH()`, they returned **13 characters** — meaning there was an extra space.

```sql
-- Check length of phone numbers
SELECT
    LENGTH(phone_number)
FROM md_water_services.employee;
```

To fix this, I applied the `TRIM()` function to remove unnecessary spaces and updated the records:

```sql
-- Remove unwanted spaces
UPDATE md_water_services.employee
SET phone_number = TRIM(phone_number);
```
✅ With these fixes, the employee table is now **clean, consistent, and ready** for the next stage of analysis.

---

## 🙌 Honouring the Workers – Finding our best
---

This part of the project was meaningful for me because it reminded me that behind every dataset are **real people** who made it possible.  
Before diving deeper into water analysis, I wanted to take a moment to **acknowledge our field workers** — the backbone of this survey.  

### 🏠 Where Do Our Employees Live?  
I started by exploring the `employee` table to see the distribution of employees across towns.  

```sql
SELECT
    town_name,
    COUNT(town_name) AS num_of_employees
FROM md_water_services.employee
GROUP BY town_name;
```

**Result sample:**

| town_name | num_of_employees |
|-----------|------------------|
| Ilanga    | 3                |
| Rural     | 29               |
| Lusaka    | 4                |
| Zanzibar  | 4                |
| Dahabu    | 6                |
| Kintampo  | 1                |
| Harare    | 5                |

➡️ A large share of our workers live in **smaller rural communities**, often far from central offices, yet they played a crucial role in gathering data under tough conditions.

### 🏅 Recognizing Top Field Surveyors

President Naledi personally asked that we recognize those who worked tirelessly in the field. To do this, I looked into the visits table to find the top 3 field surveyors based on the number of visits recorded.

```sql
SELECT
    assigned_employee_id,
    COUNT(visit_count) AS num_of_visits
FROM md_water_services.visits
GROUP BY assigned_employee_id
ORDER BY num_of_visits DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
**Result table:**

| assigned_employee_id | number_of_visits |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| 1                      | 3708             |
| 30                     | 3676             |
| 34                     | 3539             |


### 📧 Gathering Contact Info for Recognition

With the top surveyors identified, I then pulled their details from the `employee` table so that we could share their achievements and send congratulatory messages.

```sql
SELECT
    assigned_employee_id,
    employee_name,
    phone_number,
    email
FROM md_water_services.employee
WHERE assigned_employee_id IN (1, 30, 34);
```

**Result table:**

| assigned_employee_id | employee_name | phone_number  | email                        |
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| 1                     | Bello Azibo   | +99643864786  | bello.azibo@ndogowater.gov   |
| 30                    | Pili Zola     | +99822478933  | pili.zola@ndogowater.gov     |
| 34                    | Rudo Imani    | +99046972648  | rudo.imani@ndogowater.gov    |

## 🌍 Analysing Locations – Understanding where the water sources are
---

This part of the project was personal for me. I wanted to step into the shoes of the surveyors, to understand **where exactly the water sources are in Maji Ndogo**. By digging into the `location` table and focusing on `province_name`, `town_name`, and `location_type`, I could begin to see the bigger picture of our water distribution.  

---

### 🏘 Records per Town  

To start, I wrote a query to count the number of records for each town:  

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(town_name) AS records_per_town,
    town_name
FROM md_water_services.location
GROUP BY town_name
ORDER BY records_per_town DESC;
```

**Results sample:**  

| records_per_town | town_name |
|------------------|-----------|
| 23740            | Rural     |
| 1650             | Harare    |
| 1090             | Amina     |
| 1070             | Lusaka    |
| 990              | Mrembo    |
| 930              | Asmara    |
| ...              | ...       |

> At this point, it became clear to me that **the majority of water sources are concentrated in small rural communities**, scattered across Maji Ndogo.


### 🗺 Records per Province

Next, I wanted to zoom out and see the provincial picture.

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(town_name) AS records_per_province,
    province_name
FROM md_water_services.location
GROUP BY province_name
ORDER BY records_per_province DESC;
```

**Results sample:**  

| records_per_province | province_name |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| 9510                 | Kilimani      |
| 8940                 | Akatsi        |
| 8220                 | Sokoto        |
| 6950                 | Amanzi        |
| 6030                 | Hawassa       |
| ...                   | ...           |

> This showed me that every province is well represented in the dataset — giving me confidence that the survey work was thorough and reliable.

### 📊 Province + Town Breakdown

To go deeper, I combined both `province_name` and `town_name` to see how records were distributed within provinces.

```sql
SELECT
    province_name,
    town_name,
    COUNT(town_name) AS records_per_town
FROM
    md_water_services.location
GROUP BY
    province_name,
    town_name
ORDER BY
    province_name ASC,
    records_per_town DESC;
```

**Results sample:**  

| province_name | town_name | records_per_town |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| Akatsi        | Rural     | 6290             |
| Akatsi        | Lusaka    | 1070             |
| Akatsi        | Harare    | 800              |
| Akatsi        | Kintampo  | 780              |
| Amanzi        | Rural     | 3100             |
| Amanzi        | Asmara    | 930              |

> These results reassured me: our field surveyors did an excellent job documenting the country’s water crisis across every province and town.

### 🏞 Location Type Breakdown

Finally, I wanted to compare **urban vs rural sources**.

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(location_type) AS num_sources,
    location_type
FROM md_water_services.location
GROUP BY location_type;
```

**Results:**  

| num_sources | location_type |
|-------------|---------------|
| 15910       | Urban         |
| 23740       | Rural         |

> Numbers alone don’t always tell the story, so I converted this into percentages:

```sql
SELECT 23740 / (15910 + 23740) * 100;
```

> 👉 **60% of all water sources are in rural communities**.

> 💡 **Insights:**
>  
> - The dataset properly canvassed the entire country, reflecting the situation on the ground.  
> - 60% of water sources are in rural areas — which means any solutions must be designed with these communities in mind.  
> - The even provincial distribution builds confidence in the integrity of the dataset.  
>   
> For me, this analysis was more than just numbers. It showed how data can be transformed into trustworthy narratives about real communities and their struggles.

## 💦 Diving into the Sources – Seeing the scope of the problem
---

The **`water_source`** table is one of the largest in this dataset — and for me, it felt like the heart of the whole project. 🚰  

When I first opened it, I didn’t just see rows and columns — I saw stories of families, communities, and how they access something as basic (yet vital) as water.  

To really understand it, I took some time to **explore the table myself**: scanning through the columns, scribbling notes, and running queries to see what patterns would emerge.  

From this table, I could uncover two powerful pieces of information:  
- The **different types of water sources** available in Maji Ndogo  
- The **number of people depending on each one**  

---

### 🔍 Key Questions I Explored  

1. **How many people were actually surveyed in total?**  
2. **How many wells, taps, and rivers do we have recorded?**  
3. **On average, how many people share each type of water source?**  
4. **And importantly, how many people in total are served by each water source type?**  
---

#### 📝 1. Total Number of People Surveyed  
---

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(number_of_people_served) AS num_of_surveyed
FROM md_water_services.water_source;
```  
**Result:** ~27 million citizens surveyed across Maji Ndogo.

#### 📝 2. Number of Sources
---

```sql
SELECT
    type_of_water_source,
    COUNT(type_of_water_source) AS num_of_source
FROM md_water_services.water_source
GROUP BY type_of_water_source
ORDER BY num_of_source DESC;
```

**Results Sample:**

| type_of_water_source     | num_of_sources |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| well                     | 17383          |
|  tap_in_home             | 7265           |
| tap_in_home_broken       | 5856           |
| shared_tap               | 5767           |
|   river                  | 3379           |


 #### 📝 3. Average People per Source
---

```sql
SELECT 
    type_of_water_source,
    ROUND(AVG(number_of_people_served)) AS avg_served_per_source
FROM md_water_services.water_source
GROUP BY type_of_water_source;
```

**Results Sample:** Average People per Source

| type_of_water_source   | avg_served_per_source  |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| tap_in_home            | 644                    |
| tap_in_home_broken     | 649                    |
| well                   | 279                    |
| shared_tap             | 2071                   |
| river                  | 699                    |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **At first glance, this looks strange:**  
> Does a home tap really serve 644 people? Of course not.  
> Here's the catch: surveyors grouped multiple households into a single `tap_in_home` record.  
> With ~6 people per household, one entry of “644 people” actually represents about 100 taps.
>
> 💡 **Lesson Learned**  
> Data isn’t just numbers — its real value comes from interpretation.  
> Presenting raw figures to policymakers without context can be misleading.  
> Imagine being asked, “Why does it say 644 people share one home tap?” Without proper explanation, we’d have no good answer.
>
> ✅ **Clarified Insight**  
> Now the numbers make more sense: wells appear less pressured,  
> but public shared taps are under immense strain — serving over **2,000 people per tap**.

#### 📝 4. Total Population Served by Each Source
---

```sql
SELECT 
    type_of_water_source,
    SUM(number_of_people_served) AS population_served
FROM md_water_services.water_source
GROUP BY type_of_water_source
ORDER BY population_served DESC;
```

💧 **Water Source Coverage:**

<a name="my-table"></a>

| type_of_water_source     | population_served|
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Shared Tap               | 11945272        |
| Well                     | 4841724         |
| Tap in Home              | 4678880         |
| Tap in Home (Broken)     | 3799720         |
| River                    | 2362544         |

It’s hard to grasp raw totals — so I converted them into percentages.

#### 📝 5. Percentages of People Served
---

```sql
SELECT 
    type_of_water_source,
    SUM(number_of_people_served) AS Total_served_per_source,
    ROUND(
        (SUM(number_of_people_served) * 100.0 / 
            (SELECT SUM(number_of_people_served) 
             FROM md_water_services.water_source))
    ) AS Pct_served_per_source
FROM md_water_services.water_source
GROUP BY type_of_water_source
ORDER BY Pct_served_per_source DESC;
```

💧 **Water Source Distribution by Percentage:**

| type_of_water_source     | Pct_served_per_source |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Shared Tap               | 43%                   |
| Well                     | 18%                   |
| Tap in Home              | 17%                   |
| Tap in Home (Broken)     | 14%                   |
| River                    | 9%                    |

#### 📘 Making Sense of It

- **43%** of people rely on shared taps, with ~2,000 people per tap.  
  This explains the long queues we observed earlier.

- **31%** of people have taps in their homes — but almost half of them don’t work.  
  The issue isn’t the taps themselves, but the infrastructure behind them: treatment plants, pipes, and pumps.

- **18%** of people use wells, but only **28%** are clean — a major public health challenge.

---

##### 💡 Insights

- Shared taps are under the most pressure and should be the top priority for upgrades.

- Broken infrastructure is locking millions out of water access, even where taps exist.

- This dataset doesn’t just give statistics — it reflects the lived reality of communities struggling with water.

> For me, this was more than SQL queries.  
> It was about turning rows of data into a narrative of who gets water, how, and at what cost to their daily lives.

## 🛠️ Start of a Solution – Thinking about how we can repair
---

Looking at the water crisis, one thing became clear to me:  
💭 *we can’t fix everything at once.*  

So, I asked myself a simple but important question:  
**Where should we start to make the biggest impact?**  

My guiding principle was:  
👉 **Fix the water sources that serve the most people first.**

That way, every improvement reaches as many lives as possible.  

To do this, I turned to one of my favorite SQL tools: the `RANK()` window function. It allows me to order water sources by the total number of people depending on them.  

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Identify What Matters  

To answer this, I needed three key things:  

- The **type of water source** ✅  
- The **total population served per source type** ✅  
- A **rank that shows priority** 🔑  

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Explore the Data  

I took a look at the [Water Source Coverage table](#my-table) from the last query again.

Right away, **shared taps** stood out as the lifeline for millions of people, followed by **wells** and **broken taps**.  

But since *tap_in_home* already represents the ideal solution, I decided to **exclude it from the ranking**.  

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Ranking with SQL  

Here’s the query I used:  

```sql
SELECT  
    type_of_water_source,  
    SUM(number_of_people_served) AS Total_served_per_source,  
    RANK() OVER (  
        ORDER BY SUM(number_of_people_served) DESC  
    ) AS Rank_by_population  
FROM   
    md_water_services.water_source
WHERE type_of_water_source != "tap_in_home" 
GROUP BY   
    type_of_water_source;
```

🔹 **Step 3: Results**

| type_of_water_source   | Total_served_per_source | Rank_by_population |
|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| shared_tap            | 11,945,272               | 1                   |
| well                  | 4,841,724                | 2                   |
| tap_in_home_broken    | 3,799,720                | 3                   |
| river                 | 2,362,544                | 4                   |

This gave me a clear action plan:

1️⃣ Start with **shared taps**.

2️⃣ Then **improve wells**.

3️⃣ Next, fix **broken taps**.

4️⃣ And so on, down the line.

For me, this wasn’t just about ranking numbers. It was about uncovering a practical strategy to maximize impact — ensuring that the first interventions benefit the largest number of people.

### 🔹 Step 4: Ranking Individual Sources within a Type

To prioritize specific source IDs, I wrote the following query:

```sql
SELECT  
    source_id,  
    type_of_water_source,  
    number_of_people_served,  
    RANK() OVER (  
        ORDER BY number_of_people_served DESC  
    ) AS priority_rank  
FROM   
    md_water_services.water_source
WHERE type_of_water_source != "tap_in_home";
```

🔹 **Step 4: Results**

| source\_id   | type\_of\_water\_source | number\_of\_people\_served | priority\_rank |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| HaRu19509224 | shared\_tap             | 3998                       | 1              |

### 🔹 Step 5: What if we use `DENSE_RANK()`?  

While experimenting, I started wondering:  
💭 *what happens if two water sources serve the same number of people?*  

Using plain `RANK()`, SQL will **skip a number** when there’s a tie. That’s technically fine, but I felt it might be confusing for engineers or decision-makers reading the report.  

That’s when I reached for `DENSE_RANK()`.  

Unlike `RANK()`, it keeps the sequence clean — so if two water sources tie, they **share the same rank** without leaving gaps.  

This small shift makes the results easier to interpret and more intuitive for the people who’ll actually be using them to make decisions. 

```sql
SELECT  
    source_id,  
    type_of_water_source,  
    number_of_people_served,  
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (  
        ORDER BY number_of_people_served DESC  
    ) AS priority_rank  
FROM   
    md_water_services.water_source
WHERE type_of_water_source != "tap_in_home";
```

📊 **Results with DENSE_RANK**

| source\_id   | type\_of\_water\_source | number\_of\_people\_served | priority\_rank |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| HaRu19509224 | shared\_tap             | 3998                       | 1              |
| AkRu05603224 | shared\_tap             | 3998                       | 1              |

| KiRu26218224 | shared\_tap             | 3990                       | 5              |

🔎 **Difference**: With `DENSE_RANK`, the ranking feels **more natural and sequential**.


### 🔹 Step 6: What about `ROW_NUMBER()`?

`ROW_NUMBER()` forces a unique rank for every record, even when values are equal. This eliminates ambiguity for engineers deciding which exact source to fix first.

```sql
SELECT  
    source_id,  
    type_of_water_source,  
    number_of_people_served,  
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (  
        ORDER BY number_of_people_served DESC  
    ) AS priority_rank  
FROM   
    md_water_services.water_source
WHERE type_of_water_source != "tap_in_home";
```

📊 **Results with ROW_NUMBER**

| source\_id   | type\_of\_water\_source | number\_of\_people\_served | priority\_rank |

### 🛠️ Reflection

By experimenting with `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, and `ROW_NUMBER`, I realized:

- **RANK()** → Good for measuring repair progress across equal priorities.

- **DENSE_RANK()** → Easier to communicate priorities without gaps in numbers.

- **ROW_NUMBER()** → Best when every source needs a **unique repair order**.

## 📊 Analysing Queues – Uncovering when citizens collect water
--- 

This is where the project really hit me the hardest. Looking at queues might just feel like running more SQL queries, but for me, it was about visualizing the lived reality of the people in **Maji Ndogo**.  

Behind every row in the `visits` table is someone who walked for hours, stood under the sun, and waited patiently just to collect water. Sometimes children. Sometimes elders. It stopped feeling like “just data” — it became personal.  

So, I stretched out, grabbed some water myself, and dug into the data.  

---

### 📝 Recap

The `visits` table recorded all the trips our field surveyors made to each water source. For most places, one visit was enough. But when queues formed, multiple visits were made to measure how long people actually waited.  

That gave us:
- The **time** the visit was recorded  
- How **many times** a site was visited  
- And the **queue duration** at each source  

---

### ❓ What I wanted to answer
1. How long did the survey last?  
2. What’s the **average time** people spend in queues?  
3. How does queuing differ across **days of the week**?  
4. Can we break it down even further — by **hours in a day**?  

---

### ⏳ Question 1: How long did the survey take?

```sql
SELECT   
    DATEDIFF(MAX(time_of_record), MIN(time_of_record)) AS survey_duration_days  
FROM   
    md_water_services.visits;
```

📊 **Result:** `924` days (~2.5 years!)

That’s over two years of fieldwork, walking alongside people in their everyday struggle for water. It made me think: every queue time here was **real time stolen** from work, family, and education.

### ⏱️ Question 2: Average Queue Time

```sql
SELECT  
    AVG(NULLIF(time_in_queue, 0)) AS avg_time_in_queue  
FROM  
    md_water_services.visits;
```

📊 **Result:** `123` minutes

On average, people without taps at home spend **two hours** fetching water. Imagine doing this daily — the cost isn’t just time, it’s opportunity.

### 📅 Question 3: Queues by Day of the Week

```sql
SELECT   
    DAYNAME(time_of_record) AS day_of_week,  
    ROUND(AVG(time_in_queue)) AS avg_queue_time  
FROM   
    visits  
WHERE   
    time_in_queue != 0  
    AND time_in_queue IS NOT NULL  
GROUP BY   
    day_of_week;
```

📊 **Result:**

| day\_of\_week | avg\_queue\_time |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Friday        | 120              |
| Saturday      | 246              |
| Sunday        | 82               |
| Monday        | 137              |
| Tuesday       | 108              |
| Wednesday     | 97               |
| Thursday      | 105              |

➡️ Saturdays stand out: queues **double** compared to weekdays.

➡️ Sundays are lowest, reflecting cultural rest and family priorities.

### ⏰ Question 4: Queues by Hour of the Day

```sql
SELECT   
    TIME_FORMAT(TIME(time_of_record), '%H:00') AS hour_of_day,  
    ROUND(AVG(time_in_queue)) AS avg_queue_time  
FROM   
    visits  
GROUP BY   
    hour_of_day  
ORDER BY   
    hour_of_day;
```

📊 **Result (excerpt):**

| hour\_of\_day | avg\_queue\_time |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| 06:00         | 149              |
| 07:00         | 149              |
| 08:00         | 149              |
| ...           | ...              |

➡️ Mornings and evenings were peak hours — people collect water before or after work.

### 🧩 Pivoting Queue Times by Day & Hour

### 🌍 My Reflection

This was the most eye-opening part of the project for me. By pivoting the data and visualizing queues across days and hours, I could literally **see people’s daily and weekly rhythms** in the data.

- Mondays: long morning/evening queues as people prepare for the week

- Wednesdays: shortest queues (except evenings)

- Saturdays: brutal queues — people storing water for the week

- Sundays: lowest queues — time reserved for faith and family

For me, SQL stopped being just a technical tool here. It became a lens into human lives.

> 💡 **Lesson:** Data analysis isn’t just about crunching numbers — it’s about telling the human story behind the numbers.

## 📝 Reporting Insights  

As I worked through the analysis, I started thinking not just about the data, but what it really meant for people on the ground. Here’s the plan I began shaping from my findings:  

1. **Prioritize the sources that serve the most people.**  
   - Shared taps serve the largest number of people. Improving these first will have the biggest impact.  
   - Wells are widely used but many are contaminated. Fixing them would directly improve health outcomes.  
   - Repairing broken infrastructure can instantly restore access for many, while also reducing queue times for others. In this way, one intervention solves multiple problems at once.  
   - Installing household taps sounds ideal, but the data showed this would stretch resources too thin. For now, where queue times are already manageable, this won’t be a priority.  

2. **Account for rural realities.**  
   - Over **60% of water sources are in rural areas**. This means logistics matter—poor road access, limited supplies, and fewer local labor options. These challenges must shape how any intervention is planned and deployed.

## 🛠 Practical Solutions
---

From insights to action, here are the solutions I mapped out:  

| **Challenge** | **Short-Term Solution** | **Long-Term Solution** |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Communities depending on rivers | Dispatch water trucks to provide temporary relief | Drill wells for a permanent clean water source |
| Contaminated wells | Install filters (UV for biological, reverse osmosis for chemical pollution) | Investigate and address root causes of contamination |
| Overloaded shared taps | Send additional tankers at peak hours (based on queue time data) | Install new taps, aiming to keep wait times **below 30 min** (UN standard) |
| Shared taps with short queues (<30 min) | No immediate action (logistically difficult to cut further) | Gradual rollout of household taps as resources allow |
| Broken infrastructure (reservoirs, pipes, pumps) | Immediate repairs to restore access for many at once | Develop monitoring to identify and prevent recurring breakdowns |

---

✨ For me, this wasn’t just about analyzing rows and columns—it was about **turning numbers into a roadmap** that communities, engineers, and policymakers could actually use.
